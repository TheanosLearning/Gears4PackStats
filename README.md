#### About
* This branch makes an authenticated XMLHttpRequest using the [Google Sheets API v4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/)
* An access token is created using the [Chrome Identity API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/identity)

#### Requirements
* Google Chrome

#### Notes
* This branch does not offer a toggle feature. Once it is installed it will actively run unless disabled from the extension setting (chrome://extensions)
* You can check the token status in the _Identity API Token Cache_ (chrome://identity-internals)
* To run this extension with your own Google sheet, simply update the sheet Id in [cards-recorder.js](https://github.com/TheanosLearning/Gears4PackStats/blob/authxhr/gears4-pack-stats/background/cards-recorder.js#L158)
