# Gears4 Pack Stats

This branch only needs access to Google sheets.
It uses an XMLHttpRequest along with an access token from the [chrome.identity](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/identity) api.
Requires a client Id for authentication and the sheet Id for where the data should be written to.

This branch does not offer a toggle feature. Once it is installed it will actively run unless disabled from the
chrome extension settings.
