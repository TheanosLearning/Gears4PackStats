# Gears 4 Pack Stats
## A Chrome extension that tracks the cards you get while opening packs.

This extension works from ```https://gearsofwar.com/{locale}/cards/my-packs/{pack}```.
Upon clicking the **REVEAL ALL** button, your pack contents will be sent to the community
Google sheet ```Gears4 Pack Stats``` where it will be used to help us analyze things such
as drop rate, card frequency, credit per scrape ratio etc..
